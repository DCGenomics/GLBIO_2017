# GLBIO_2017
Matchmaking in Bioinformatics session @ GLBIO2017

Session description:  Biologists and clinicians often ask about available public data, tools and strategies for domain specific use cases. Computational biologists often seek users and aim to develop tools that fill a gap in biological data analysis and interpretation. The aim of the MiB@GLBIO session (which stands for Matchmaking in Bioinformatics, BTW) is to engage biologists and computational biologists in discussing and finding solutions, through potential collaborations, to their needs in a fun and specific way. 
During this session, in addition to having a series of quick talks about specific tools and resources, we will also have  “speed-dating” time (hence, the matchmaking theme), where tool developers/analysis experts will briefly interact with bench scientists/novice researchers to determine whether future conversations/collaborations are useful and whether they have interests in common. Major topics of broad interest, such as RNA-seq isoform specificity, Chromatin Accessibility, and Evolution, will be included.
